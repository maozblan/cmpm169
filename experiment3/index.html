			<h1>Experiment 3 - Generative Methods</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I started with Prof Wes' L-systems code and the wikipedia for the Dragon curve. I got it to work on the system to draw a set generation of dragon curves then broke it by messing with the angles.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>The L-system was rewritten with mathematical vectors and normalizing the vectors to calculate the exact points on which the lines should be drawn to. This way, the Dragon Curve could be drawn without rotating or translating the canvas. By setting variables to the starting x, y, and angle, the fireworks were pieced together with rotating multiple broken Dragon Curves about the same point.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>The fireworks where lastly given stems so they would go up, pause a moment, then explode. By chance, I broke a firework so much it shot out in straight lines and I kept that as a variation. I took the fading idea from Experiment 2 and implemented here too. But instead of decreasing the alpha on the lines, I kept painting a translucent layer of black each frame to fade the lines drawn on the last frame slowly into the dark again. It was a whole lot of math and tweaking numbers until it looked right but hey, it works! Finally for fun, I added in red fireworks for wherever the user clicks.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>It was a single person project but I asked my friend to help me with the math calculations when I decided it was a good idea to calculate dragon curve points by hand. So then I got a friend of mine to help me with the calculation between points of the dragon curve. I explained the algorithm and what I was trying to do to him and he helped with a lot of the calculations.</p>
