		<h3>project description</h3>
		<p>click to spawn a white firework.</p>
		<p>this piece focuses on creating art with L-system (generative method). currently there are fireworks made from the
			dragon curve and the fractal tree, all very common systems. every so often there is a mutated firework.</p>
		<h3>credit where credit is due</h3>
		<p class="c">code for l-systems in p5 based off of <a
				href="https://editor.p5js.org/wmodes/sketches/UoSg_99pH">l-system sample</a> by wes modes</p>
		<p class="c"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system">wikipedia</a> for defining L-systems and breaking them
			down into understandable terms</p>
		<p class="c">and here is the <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/maozblan/sketches/4Vrlx9Mbu">original version</a> of
			the project on p5</p>
		<br />
		<br />
		<h3>devlog 2025 01 27</h3>
		<p>refactored the code to support multiple different types of fireworks. added in the fractal tree firework.</p>
		<p>added in color variation using HSL color format as it was easier to get a full range of pastel colors from that.
			i hoped to use pastel colors as they are much more vibrant on a black background</p>
		<p>changed to instance mode, though that was not used for much as of right now.</p>
		<br />
		<h3>devlog 2024 01 29</h3>
		<h3>Imitate</h3>
		<p>I started with Prof Wes' L-systems code and the wikipedia for the Dragon curve. I got it to work on the
			system to draw a set generation of dragon curves then broke it by messing with the angles.</p>

		<h3>Integrate</h3>
		<p>The L-system was rewritten with mathematical vectors and normalizing the vectors to calculate the exact
			points on which the lines should be drawn to. This way, the Dragon Curve could be drawn without rotating or
			translating the canvas. By setting variables to the starting x, y, and angle, the fireworks were pieced
			together with rotating multiple broken Dragon Curves about the same point.</p>

		<h3>Innovate</h3>
		<p>The fireworks where lastly given stems so they would go up, pause a moment, then explode. By chance, I broke
			a firework so much it shot out in straight lines and I kept that as a variation. I took the fading idea from
			Experiment 2 and implemented here too. But instead of decreasing the alpha on the lines, I kept painting a
			translucent layer of black each frame to fade the lines drawn on the last frame slowly into the dark again. It
			was a whole lot of math and tweaking numbers until it looked right but hey, it works! Finally for fun, I added
			in red fireworks for wherever the user clicks.</p>

		<h3>Reflection</h3>
		<p>It was a single person project but I asked my friend to help me with the math calculations when I decided it
			was a good idea to calculate dragon curve points by hand. So then I got a friend of mine to help me with the
			calculation between points of the dragon curve. I explained the algorithm and what I was trying to do to him
			and he helped with a lot of the calculations.</p>
