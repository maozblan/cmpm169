			<h1>Experiment 7 - Data Visualization & Networks</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>Didn't know what to do for this one so imitated one of my older assignments with drawing and animating silly lines all over the place. Ended up wanting to animate my schedule over the course of a day for fun because I felt like I was outside a lot.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>I integrated it with line graphs and huge JSON data file (well a fake one because I didn't feel like handwriting all the data so half of it is calculated in the JS file). Then I used an OOP class to make multiple lines since I go permission from my roommates to animate their schedules too!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>Decided to add onto it and write another OOP class that is linked fo the first one to keep track of the time. Also decided to add in keyboard interactions for more fun so the user can watch the schedules fall together. It's kinda cool because you can kinda see who has the same classes together and who doesn't. Or when everyone is busy and out of the house.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>me, myself, and I + emotional support person</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>use number keys to interact. the red line is my schedule if you are curious!</p>
				<p>mapped minutes away from bed via walking... the lower the line, the further from bed :(</p>
