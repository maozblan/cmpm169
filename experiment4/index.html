			<h1>Experiment 4 - Images, Video, & Sound Art</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>Started out with some image distortion program I found on open processing and just decided to mess with it little by little.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>Then I started added various elements to it such as music and messing with things about amps or and pitches with the circle to incorportate it into the image a bit more. There was a lot of messing with the lengths and sizes of everything until it looked alright.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>And then decided to incorportate the particles with the music and had it draw as closely to the beat as I could get it to. Along with the music circle. Along with a couple other touches of just aesthetics and all. Now the music affects more than just the amplitude circle. The amplitude affect the length and width of the lines and the pitch affects when new lines are drawn.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Me, myself, and I in my room staring at starry night for too long.</p>
