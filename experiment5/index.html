			<h1>Experiment 5 - 3D Graphics</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>This was a whole journey because there was a lot of different ones I wanted to work with in the beginning but none of them really worked out... so I had to keep switching and being undecisive before going for the sphere explosion one.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>Worked with the particles and ambient light and emissiveMaterial() to try to make it look like they all glow a bit. Then I added in object pooling that I learnt in another class to help with the major lag when the user spam clicks.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>I decided to combine another project from openprocessing (the one where they had mockup of collision) here and have the stars boxed together and blink over time. Just a little box of galaxy :D I also increased the lifespan so that the user could watch the mini box of a galaxy sparkle and twinkle before the stars all inevitably die.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Just me and myself at wayyy too late at night.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>click!</p>
