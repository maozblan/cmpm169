			<h1>Experiment 6 - Grammars & Text Art</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I started out with adding the ascii meatballs that were shown in class and messing around here and there with the code until I got it to work on my system.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>I wasn't sure what to add in so I just changed the ASCII and the color and stared at it for a whole lot longer. The code was particularly hard to mess with this time because it was so nicely and densely written changing anything caused a whole lot of errors to pop up on screen.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>I thought about my previous experiments and decided to implement that along with this current one in terms of color scheme. Also looked back into other lectures for inspiration and found the video camera into pixelated chinese character images very similar to what I was messing around with so I just took that too.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Me, myself, and I, and the laptop at an actually reasonable hour.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>drag your mouse around!</p>
