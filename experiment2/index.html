				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>The main inspirtation for this project was broken into two parts, inpiration for the feeling of the piece and the imitation material for the technical aspects. The feels were inspired from the music video cover for the Chinese song 雾里 (wu li) and ph4se.space's space drawing. Meanwhile, the technical aspects were drawn from Vivek Singh Negi's fractal forest, and Professor Wes' single line noise. I took the source code and worked with it until I was comfortable enough to play around and went from there.</p>

				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>I brought together the trees and the lines to make this misty feeling using the trees to build a forest and the slow rolling of the lines to make abstract mist. The color palette from the music video really brought it together. I brought in some knowledge I have about making visual art and the ideas of depth both in layers and in colors to help give the forest some more life. First, I slid the mist between layers of trees to give the forest some depth into "the distance." Second, I tried to fade out the lines slowly to give a bit more mistly effect and have it roll like smoke. To make it "fade out," I wrote up a bit </p>

				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>I really liked the idea of rolling smoke so I tried to add a bit of abstract birds. I wanted them to spawn every so often but found it more interactive and fun if the user can spawn them where ever they liked. Thus I implemented a click handler. Drawing from the Star, Line, and Field classes in the integrated code, I wrote my own Bird and Flock classes. The Bird class mimiced the logic from Line class, creating individual instances of a shape with it's own data and draw function. Like the Field class, the Flock class collects instances of Birds to an array and draws them. Instead of an infinitely updating array, the Flock contains a random number of Birds and slowly fades them out. The fadeout technique was the same as the mist's with the decrease of alpha. However, this one is randomized to create much more variety. In the end, the feeling of the birds looked much more like the Stars although it was based mostly on the mist.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This was a one person project. I did the whole thing... There were plenty of highs and lows, such as trying to cram it over the week and on Friday afternoon right before the hackathon, not making it before the hackathon started, showing my friends during hackathon (they really liked it!), and adding it to the hackathon project haha. I definitely don't want to procastinate as much next time, this sucked. But hey, I got through it and I really like what I made.</p>
